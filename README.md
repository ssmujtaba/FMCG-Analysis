# üõí FMCG Sales Analysis Dashboard

## üéØ Project Goal

The primary objective of this project was to analyze three months of sales data to identify key trends, evaluate performance across different branches and product categories, and understand customer purchasing behavior. The goal was to move beyond simple reporting to create a diagnostic tool that could answer critical business questions and support data-driven decision-making.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills and Process

- **Data Modeling**: The raw CSV data was loaded into Power BI and transformed into a robust **Star Schema**. This involved creating a central `Sales` fact table and connecting it to `Products` and `Calendar` dimension tables, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.

- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Over 15 DAX measures were created to calculate key business metrics, including:
  - **Time intelligence measures** (e.g., `Sales Last Month`, `Month-over-Month Growth`)
  - **Advanced KPIs** (e.g., `Average Transaction Value`, `Average Items per Transaction`)
  - **Conditional formatting measures** to dynamically highlight performance against targets.

- **Data Visualization**: A multi-page report was designed with a focus on user experience, interactivity, and clear data storytelling.

- **Power Query (M Language)**: A dynamic and reusable calendar table was built using M language to support all time-based analysis.
